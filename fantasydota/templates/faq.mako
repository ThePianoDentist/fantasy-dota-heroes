    FAQ page for fantasy dota
</%def>

<div>
<h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <div class="card-panel">
<p>
    Simple fantasy dota style game. You put the heroes in your team you think are likely to be picked/banned and win.<br>
When this happens you get points.<br>
    Send feedback/questions to fantasydotaeu@gmail.com or <a href="https://discord.gg/MAH7EEv" target=_blank">discord</a><br>
    Source-code available here https://github.com/ThePianoDentist/fantasy-dota-heroes (my instructions for setting up/running are abysmal, PM me for that)
</p>
    </div>
<h2>Are there any prizes?</h2>
    <div class="card-panel">
<p>
    Choice of any standard arcana for winner. Prize sponsored by <a href="https://stratz.com">Stratz Esports</a> (DotA 2 statistics & analytics).<br>
(If points are tied, winner will be decided by wins, picks, bans in that order. For identical teams winner drawn from hat)
<br>
    Obviously I cannot get you IO arcana (not tradeable)<br><br>
*Disclaimer: Although this site is still my independent project, I am currently working for Stratz-Esports.

<h2>Mobile/App version of site?</h2>
    <div class="card-panel">
<p>Sorry, doesn't seem to be enough demand for me to make one right now.
</p>
    </div>
<h2>Aren't there already fantasy dota games?</h2>
    <div class="card-panel">
<p>
Yeah there's the official stuff, and other third party stuff.<br>
My problem with these is being based on pro players, I have to keep track of what teams are playing on what days,
who's been knocked out, which Chinese Dota players are good etc.<br>
I actually have to pay attention. I wanted a fantasy league that was a bit more casual.<br>
The least clicks possible to add extra interest to games

<h2>Why do later phase picks/bans/wins get bonus points?</h2>
    <div class="card-panel">
<p>
This is so that people do not just instantly fill their team with the most imba-heroes who are guarantee 1st phase pick/ban<br>
A little bit of thought has to be put in to trade-off pick-rate with bonus points for less in demand heroes
</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Why is there a big points multiplier for main event?</h2>
    <div class="card-panel">
<p>
Because there are so many group games compared to main event, in the past, the tournament would be pretty much decided after the group stage.<br>
    If you weren't top ~15 after group stage...might as well give up.<br>
    With these multipliers you can still come back and win after a mediocre group stage performance.
