                <li>(Win/Loss applies to picked heroes, but not banned heroes.)</li>

            Missing heroes penalty multiplier:</br>
            <ul class="browser-default"><li>x0.5 for every missing hero  (to prevent people abusing half-empty teams of best heroes)
            </li></ul>

            <li>
                Your Main team can consist of up to 5 dota heroes (you are not required to use all 5, but you incur a heavy percentage penalty for each missing hero).
            </li>
            <li>
                Your Reserve team also consists of up to 5 heroes, worth 50 credits. These earn 0 points whilst in your reserves. But they can be swapped into your main team midway through the tournament.
            </li>
            <li>
            Your main team will always have a 50 credit limit. i.e. You must remove 20 credits worth of heroes from Main team, before promoting a reserve hero worth 20 credits.
            </li>
            <li>
            Hero values will remain static throughout the tournament.

        Points are allocated in the following way:</br>

    </br>
        Points are weighted heavily towards kills over position because that seems fun to me.
    </br>
        Points system has to be simple until PUBG has available data API's or replay systems.

            </li>
            <li>
                Your Reserve team also consists of up to 2 players. These earn 0 points whilst in your reserves. But they can be swapped into your main team between tournament days.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are only allowed one player from each PUBG team in your main team. You can have a second TSM, Liquid etc player in your reserves, however you can only swap him in for the other TSM, Liquid player in main team.
            </li>
            <li>
            The credit values do not really mean anything right now. However for future tournaments, players may be assigned different values based on their perceived ability.
