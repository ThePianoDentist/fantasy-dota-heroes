Need to:
- have transfers be open for late starters (can we have team created/transfer go through hours later like with swaps?)
- add toggle for leaderboards to show late starters
- add message saying cant make transfers until swaps go through, hence greyed out
- hyperlink for matches in daily
- add pro circuit tournaments so get data retrieves results
- test notification/achievement system
- make sure weekends worth double
- handle uniques league to game, so only need to store league cookie, not game
- add charity stuff
- migrate user script
- check about updating Sale so stores swaps as well
- update rules/faq to talk about late starting
